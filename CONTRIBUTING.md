Formatting your own emoji:
- Emoji should be 256x256 in size exactly
- Export/Save your files as `.png`
- Add your emojis in `emojis/png`
- Do **not** run the `make:others` script for *your* Pull Request as this will make a big mess of changes

General guidelines (but not strict rules) for emojis:
- Try to make emojis usable in many contexts (e.g., tools, emotions, places, etc.)
- Use a transparent background (unless the emoji entails otherwise)
- Avoid looking out of place from other emojis
- Avoid anti-aliasing (unless you need it for zooming/resizing, or messing with rotation/perspective)
- Important features such as eyes or mouth should be at least 4 pixels large (usually this is the outline/border)
- When making multiple emojis, similar emojis should start with the same name (e.g., alien, alienhappy, aliengreen, aliengreenhappy)

Rules for this repository:
- No emojis ripped/traced directly from another emoji set (e.g., Twemoji, Apple emojis, etc.)
- Emoji file names must be lowercase and only use characters a-z
- All content must be appropriate for ages 10+ or in the standard emoji set (e.g., no bloody faces)
- SFW (Safe for Work) content only. Suggestive/sexual content is not tolerated.
- All content must not have any special restrictions (e.g., only Steamboat Willie is public domain but not recent versions of Mickey)
- AI-Generated content will be ignored and closed. You aren't a chef if you can only order food.
